# VK Social Media Smart Contract

Welcome to the VK Social Media Smart Contract repository! This project demonstrates a simple social media platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can create posts, like and unlike posts, and query posts from the blockchain.


## Features

- **Create Posts**: Users can add content to the blockchain, which is timestamped and stored securely.
- **Interact with Posts**: Each post can be liked or unliked, with the total like count stored on-chain.
- **Query Posts**: Users can retrieve a single post or all posts created by a specific user.
- **Adjust Post Settings**: The contract owner can adjust the maximum post length.
